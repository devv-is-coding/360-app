 * Derived from the invoice's amounts by a pure function, never assigned - the
 * same rule as a booking's payment status, so the status cannot contradict the
 * payment ledger beneath it.
 *
 * Note what is deliberately absent: there is no Overdue case. Overdue is a
 * function of today's date (`status is not Paid AND due_on < today`), so storing
 * it would require a nightly job to flip it and would drift the moment that job
 * failed. A status that depends on the clock does not belong in a column.
