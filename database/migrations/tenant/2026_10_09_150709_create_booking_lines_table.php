     * New table, and the structural fix for defect 4. The legacy put a single
     * `option_id` on the invoice and added UNIQUE(invoice_id, option_id) on top,
     * so two rooms - or a tour plus a visa - could not be expressed at all.
     *
     * The honest limit: a booking row lives in one tenant database, so a tour
     * from agency A plus a visa from agency B is necessarily two bookings. An
     * unavoidable consequence of multi-database tenancy. A central cart may
     * group them for checkout, but the records stay separate.
     *
     * The snapshot columns are as much the point as the one-to-many is:
     * `item_name`, `option_name`, `item_type`, `availability_mode` and
     * `unit_price_minor` are copied at purchase, so a 2024 booking still renders
     * correctly after the catalog is renamed and repriced.
     *
     * `adults`, `kids` and `baggage_count` are the legacy `invoice_attributes`
     * EAV values promoted to real columns.
     *
     * Per-mode date semantics, which are easy to get wrong:
     *
     *   Capacity (tour)  - copied from the item's departure window, INCLUSIVE of
     *                      both ends. `nights` is NULL.
     *   Nightly (hotel)  - the guest's range, HALF-OPEN [starts_on, ends_on).
     *                      The check-out day is not a consumed night, which is
     *                      what makes back-to-back bookings work.
     *   Unlimited (visa) - both NULL, and no allocation rows at all.
     *
     * Never compare these dates by hand; always route through the date-range
     * value object, because mixing the conventions is the most common
     * hotel-availability bug there is.
