     * New table, and the fix for defect 9. The legacy modelled a refund as eight
     * columns on the invoice itself, plus three more on `payments`. That shape
     * permits exactly one refund per booking, ever - two successive partial
     * refunds were unrepresentable.
     *
     * The negotiation is ported faithfully: the customer requests with a reason,
     * a manager approves full or partial - or rejects with a reason - and only
     * then is it processed against the gateway. Approving is what returns the
     * inventory, by hard-deleting the booking's allocation rows so the freed
     * unit index becomes immediately rebookable.
     *
     * A refund can never exceed the booking's paid amount less prior refunds.
     * That is a condition across rows, so it is a service-layer invariant backed
     * by a randomised test rather than a constraint.
