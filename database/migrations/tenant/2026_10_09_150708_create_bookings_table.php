    /**
     * The legacy `invoices` table, renamed. This row is a *booking*; an invoice
     * is a billing document, and `payments` already models the money. That
     * misnomer is much of what made the legacy's two status axes look confusing
     * when they were in fact deliberate.
     *
     * Three orthogonal axes, and they must stay orthogonal:
     *
     *   `approval_status`   - the manager's decision
     *   `payment_status`    - the money state, always derived, never assigned
     *   `fulfilment_status` - whether the guest turned up (new)
     *
     * The proof the first two were meant to be independent is in the legacy
     * data: a rejected booking keeps its payment status at Unpaid. Preserved.
     *
     * `items.id` and `options.id` are gone from this row. The legacy carried a
     * single `option_id` plus UNIQUE(invoice_id, option_id), so booking two
     * rooms was unrepresentable - defect 4, fixed by `booking_lines`.
     *
     * The eight refund columns the legacy carried here are gone too; they
     * permitted exactly one refund per booking, ever. Defect 9.
     *
     * `amount_paid_minor` and `amount_refunded_minor` are not a second source of
     * truth: both are recomputed as a SUM inside the same transaction that
     * writes a payment or refund, and never incremented - incrementing is how
     * balances drift.
