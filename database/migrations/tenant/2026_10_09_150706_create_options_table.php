    /**
     * The bookable unit, and the most important structural idea carried over
     * from the capstone. An option is a priced, countable variant of an item -
     * Solo/Couple/Family for a tour, Room 101 for a hotel, e-Visa for a visa.
     * Keeping it generic across all three types is what lets one booking engine
     * serve everything.
     *
     * Three changes from the legacy `options` table:
     *
     * `price` was `double(10,2)`. Money is now an integer count of minor units
     * in `price_minor`, which an architecture test enforces across the whole
     * schema. Defect 2.
     *
     * `available_quantity` is gone. It duplicated the inventory ledger and was
     * the value that drifted, so availability is always derived from batches
     * minus allocations and never stored.
     *
     * `availability_mode` is new and lives here rather than on `items`, so
     * options stay genuinely generic - one hotel can sell both a per-night room
     * and a fixed-date New Year's package.
     *
     * There is no `currency` column: a tenant trades in exactly one currency,
     * held in `tenants.data` where the central marketplace can read it without
     * initialising tenancy.
