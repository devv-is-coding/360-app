     * Many payments per booking. Deposit-then-balance is a first-class flow, not
     * an edge case: the real sequence in the legacy data is staff recording cash
     * 400.00 against a 599.00 booking, the customer later settling the 199.00
     * balance through a hosted invoice link, and a webhook closing it out.
     *
     * Three fixes from the legacy `payments` table:
     *
     * `paid_on` was an `int(11)` unix timestamp; it is a real timestamp here.
     * Defect 10.
     *
     * `amount_paid` was `double(10,2)`; money is now integer minor units.
     * Defect 2.
     *
     * `idempotency_key` is new and unique, so a replayed webhook cannot
     * double-credit a booking.
     *
     * The legacy's three refund columns on this table have moved to `refunds`,
     * along with the eight that were on the booking.
     *
     * This table is the source of truth for how much has been paid.
     * `bookings.amount_paid_minor` is recomputed from it as a SUM inside the
     * same transaction, never incremented.
