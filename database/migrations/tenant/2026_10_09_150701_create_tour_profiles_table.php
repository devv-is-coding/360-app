     * and "Meeting Point".
     *
     * A per-type satellite rather than one wide `items` table or a JSON blob: a
     * wide table would force every type-specific column nullable, destroying the
     * validation being bought, and a blob would lose queryability too. Here the
     * constraints are real and visible to PHPStan.
     *
     * `departs_on`/`returns_on` are the departure window, inclusive of both
     * ends, which Capacity-mode options consume seats for. The legacy held this
     * as EAV text, which is how one row ended up with the end year 0026 and
     * another ended before it started. Defect 3.
     *
     * Free-form lists stay JSON behind a cast that validates every element is a
     * string - validation at the model boundary, which the EAV never had.
