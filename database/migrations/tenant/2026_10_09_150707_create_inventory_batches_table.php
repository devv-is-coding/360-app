     * The additions half of the inventory ledger, ported from the legacy

     * and that design is kept: available = SUM(batches) - COUNT(allocations).
     * There is no `capacity_per_night` column anywhere, because a second source
     * of capacity would double-count.
     *
     * `effective_from`/`effective_to` are new, and make "three extra rooms,
     * December only" expressible - impossible in the legacy, where a batch
     * applied forever.
     *
     * `added_by` is nullable here, where the legacy had it NOT NULL and then
     * stored `added_by = 1` pointing at a user that does not exist, against a
     * users table whose ids start at 13. Because the actor is a central user in
     * another database, no foreign key can enforce this; the fix is validation
     * in the service layer, with a test named after defect 8.
