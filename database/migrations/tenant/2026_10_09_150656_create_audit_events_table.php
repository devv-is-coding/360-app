     * Append-only audit trail for everything that happens inside this tenant.
     *
     * This one shape replaces the legacy's two redundant tables (`logs` and
     * `histories`, which differed only in payload): `changes` carries the
     * old/new diff `histories` held, `context` the arbitrary metadata `logs`
     * held. Defect 5.
     *
     * Rows are routed by where the *subject* lives, not by who the actor is, so
     * an audit record is co-located with the data it describes and survives and
     * dies with it. Platform-level actions go to the central
     * `platform_audit_events` table instead.
     *
     * A super admin may write a platform lifecycle notice here - a suspension or
     * closure the agency is entitled to a permanent local record of - but never
     * an operational action. `actor_role = SuperAdmin` against anything other
     * than a `tenant.*` action is a governance violation.
     *
     * There is no `updated_on` and no soft delete: audit rows are never modified
     * or removed, which the model enforces in `booted()`. Retention is handled
     * by pruning old rows outright.
