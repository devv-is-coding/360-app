     * Ported from the legacy `tour_visits` - a customer checking in at an
     * itinerary stop - and extended to cover the second scan direction.
     *
     * Two flows share this table:
     *
     *   Tour  - the guest scans a stop's QR, so `itinerary_stop_id` is set.
     *           Because geofencing is out of scope the QR is the sole proof of
     *           presence, so the stop's code is a short-lived rotating token
     *           rendered on the guide's device, not a static printed sheet that
     *           could be photographed and shared.
     *   Hotel - staff scan the guest's booking QR, so `itinerary_stop_id` is
     *           NULL and `recorded_by` is the staff member. Cross-tenant use is
     *           already blocked by the tenant middleware on the scanning session.
     *
     * UNIQUE(customer_id, itinerary_stop_id) prevents a double check-in at one
     * stop. Note the honest limits: for the hotel flow the stop is NULL, and
     * repeated NULLs do not collide on either driver, so "one check-in per
     * booking" there is a service-layer rule. And a customer who books the same
     * tour twice can only check in at a given stop once - the key should be
     * UNIQUE(booking_id, itinerary_stop_id), which is an approved fix pending
     * the next rebuild.
     *
     * `auto_detected` is deliberately dropped. Without geofencing nothing would
     * ever write it, and a column no producer sets is worse than no column.
