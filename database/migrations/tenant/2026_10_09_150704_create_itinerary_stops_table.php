     * The ordered route of a tour, ported from the legacy `details` table.
     *
     * `sequence` makes the order explicit rather than implicit in insertion
     * order, and drives the numbered markers and polyline on the map.
     *
     * The coordinates are finally used: they existed in the legacy and every
     * row was NULL, so no map was ever drawn. Defect 11.
     *
     * There is deliberately no soft delete. A tombstone would keep occupying its
     * slot in UNIQUE(item_id, sequence) and block that position from being
     * reused when stops are reordered - the same reasoning that makes inventory
     * allocations hard-delete on release. Check-in history survives a deleted
     * stop through its own snapshot instead.
