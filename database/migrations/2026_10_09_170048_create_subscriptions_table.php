     * The platform's commercial relationship with one agency: what it pays, how
     * often, and whether that arrangement is currently live.
     *
     * Central, not tenant-side, and not as a style choice. The super admin has
     * to answer "which agencies are due or overdue?" in one query; held in
     * tenant databases it would be a fan-out over every agency on the platform.
     * It is also a different money flow from the tenant-side `payments` table:
     * that one is customers paying agencies, this one is agencies paying the
     * platform. Different parties, different currency, different lifecycle.
     *
     * `status` is deliberately independent of `tenants.status`. A subscription
     * may be PastDue while the agency is still Active and trading, because an
     * unpaid invoice is a fact and suspending access is a separate decision.
     * Collapsing the two would mean a missed bank transfer takes a storefront
     * down the morning it falls due.
     *
     * The plan is held as snapshots rather than a foreign key. There is no
     * `subscription_plans` table yet, and because these columns record what the
     * agency actually agreed to, one can be added later without migrating a
     * single existing row.
