     * One row per billing period: what the platform charged an agency, when it
     * fell due, and how much of it has been settled.
     *
     * The shape deliberately mirrors `bookings` - an amount, a running
     * `amount_paid_minor`, and a status derived from the two - because that is
     * the shape already proven to keep a balance honest. `amount_paid_minor` is
     * recomputed as a SUM over `subscription_payments` inside the same
     * transaction that writes a payment, and never incremented.
     *
     * There is no `overdue` column. Overdue is `status is not Paid AND due_on <
     * today` - a function of the clock, which has no business being stored. A
     * flag would need a nightly job to flip it and would be silently wrong the
     * first time that job failed.
     *
     * Voiding rather than deleting is how a charge is withdrawn, so the record
     * of having issued it survives. There is deliberately no refund table for
     * platform fees: voiding covers the realistic case.
