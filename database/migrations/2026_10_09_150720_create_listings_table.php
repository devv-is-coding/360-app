     * The central discovery projection: one row per published item, copied out
     * of whichever tenant database owns it.
     *
     * Customers must search across every agency, but listings live in isolated
     * tenant databases. Request-time fan-out dies at around twenty tenants, and
     * the tenancy package's resource syncing is built for central-to-many
     * mirroring rather than many-to-one aggregation. So published items are
     * projected here by queued domain events, reconciled nightly, with
     * `synced_on` making staleness observable. A search engine would later index
     * this same table, which makes adopting one a config change rather than a
     * re-architecture.
     *
     * THE INVARIANT, which must never be violated: this table is for DISCOVERY
     * ONLY. It is never the source of truth for price or availability. Both the
     * detail page and the booking transaction re-read those authoritatively
     * inside the tenant database. Staleness can therefore only produce "search
     * said 499, the detail page says 549" - irritating, never a financial error.
     *
     * Marketplace queries must also join `tenants.status`, so a suspended or
     * closed agency disappears from the marketplace. Tenant status is
     * deliberately NOT denormalised here: a copy would drift and would need
     * every listing re-projected on every status change, and the foreign key is
     * in this same database so the join is free.
