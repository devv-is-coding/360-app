     * Many payments per invoice, because part-payment of a platform fee is as
     * real as a deposit on a booking.

     * The shape mirrors the tenant-side `payments` table deliberately, including
     * `paid_on` as a real timestamp rather than the legacy's `int(11)` unix
     * integer (defect 10), and the unique `idempotency_key` so a replayed
     * gateway webhook cannot credit an invoice twice.
     *
     * Reuses `PaymentMethod` and `PaymentRecordStatus` rather than duplicating
     * them: cash, card, Stripe and bank transfer mean the same thing whoever is
     * paying whom.
