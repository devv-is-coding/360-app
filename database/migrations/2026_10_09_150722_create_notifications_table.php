     * The in-app notification feed, ported from the legacy `notifications` table
     * and kept central so the bell renders in one query. A customer books with
     * several agencies, so a per-tenant table would mean fanning out over every
     * tenant database on every page load.
     *
     * This deliberately diverges from Laravel's `DatabaseNotification` shape,
     * which stores everything in one JSON blob. Typed columns turn "unread
     * booking notifications for tenant X" into a column filter instead of a JSON
     * scan. The cost: `$user->notifications()` from the `Notifiable` trait will
     * NOT work against this table, so the feed needs its own model and relation.
     * The trait stays on the user model for mail delivery only.
     *
     * Every row is written from a domain event, never from UI code, and any
     * money in a body is formatted through the money value object - the legacy
     * shipped a customer a notification containing the literal text
     * 30.00999999999999801048033987, which is defect 2 reaching a real person.
